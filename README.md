# AIAutoCommenter

A user-friendly Python application that uses AI to analyze and auto-generate comments for Python code. Simply select a `.py` file using the GUI then click the ai comment button, and the app adds human-readable comments that explain what it does.

This project applies **AI-Driven Development (AIDD)** principles in a practical tool, complete with a clean graphical interface built using `Tkinter`. It is designed to run as a standalone Windows executable, making it easy to use without needing Python installed.

## Features

- **Select `.py` Files** – Select any Python script and display the file in the GUI.
- **AI-Powered Commenting** – Generates clear comments using OpenAI API.
- **Download Updated Files** – Save the updated version locally using the GUI.
- **Graphical Interface** – Built with `tkinter` and `customtkinter` for a modern, intuitive UI.
- **Standalone Executable** – Packaged with `PyInstaller` to run on Windows without Python installed.
